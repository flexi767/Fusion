/*
FNXC:WorkflowLifecycleColumns 2026-07-31-02:40 (batch-core feed: task-update.ts 3 → 0):

THE HEADLINE IS NOT A RENAMED BOARD — IT IS A COLUMN THAT NO LONGER EXISTS.

Adding a new dependency to a hold-lane card re-seeds it for re-specification, and the destination was
the literal `"triage"`. U11 (#2515) DELETED that column. The default lineage is now
`todo | in-progress | in-review | done | archived`, so on a STOCK board — no renaming involved —
this moved the card into a column nothing declares and nothing renders. The card leaves its lane and
appears in none, recoverable only by moving it back by hand.

The old behaviour therefore cannot be preserved: the column it targeted is gone. The card now stays
put when the intake lane is where it already is (the default board's case), while the status reset
and the log entry still record the re-specification.

WHEN THE WORKFLOW WILL NOT RESOLVE, THE COLUMN IS LEFT ALONE. There is deliberately no literal
fallback for the DESTINATION: refusing to move is recoverable; writing a column that may not exist is
what caused this. The source-lane check keeps its documented literal default, because failing to
recognise the hold lane only skips the re-seed.

SECOND SITE: clearing the `paused` STATUS on unassignment. Keyed on the wip/review literals, a
renamed board left `status: "paused"` behind after the pause itself was lifted — a card that is not
paused but says it is, in every status-driven surface, forever.

REVERT PROOF, measured: restore `task.column = "triage"` and the first case fails on the column
value; restore the wip/review literals and the renamed-unassign case fails. 3 of 5 fail overall.
