Session cost is shown in two places that must never disagree: a compact badge on every list card, and the
full breakdown in session detail. Both derive from this one summary so a provider mapping or a
complete/partial rule can only be changed in one place.

`estimatedUsd` is a whole-session total and is null unless EVERY reported usage record priced, because a
number that silently omits an unknown model reads as the session's real cost. `partialUsd` carries what did
price, so the operator sees "some of this is unknown" rather than either a wrong total or nothing at all.

Fusion's catalog is a single current baseline with one `pricingAsOf` date; neither it nor the operator
overrides carry per-rate effective dates, so there is NO record of what a model cost in the past. A figure for
an old session is therefore a recalculation at today's rates, not what that work was billed.

Rather than invent a rate history, every cost states the basis it was computed on and whether the work
predates it. `recalculated` is true only when the activity is older than the basis date, which is exactly the
case where presenting the number as "the cost" would be false.

Why work was expensive, from measured counts and the rates actually applied — never a narrative guess. Each
category charge is the reported token count for that category times the rate used to price it, and the
categories are disjoint by construction in priceUsage (input excludes cached and cache-write; cacheWrite
excludes the one-hour portion), so they sum to the record's own total. A test pins that sum, because a driver
breakdown that does not reconcile with the total is worse than none: it looks like an explanation.

Only priced records contribute. An unpriced record cannot say what drove its cost, so it is counted and
reported as unexplained rather than folded in at zero.
