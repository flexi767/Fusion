/*
FNXC:WorkflowScheduling 2026-08-12-20:00 (RUFU-073):
REG RUFU-073 — one scheduler tick must read each task's workflow_selection AT MOST ONCE.

The production query storm (`project.task_workflow_selection` idx_scan ~232 q/s nonstop) was Drizzle
building the same SELECT over and over: `resolveTaskParkedColumns` composed `resolveWorkflowIrForTask`
per call, and in a single scheduler event the SAME task could trip several park-resolutions (merge,
unpause, planning-finished, approval-cleared, deleted, agent-link rollback) — each its own separate DB
read of the selection, even though `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` provides a caller-owned selection cache.

Fix: a fresh per-tick/per-event `selectionCache` (Map<taskId, selection>) is shared by every
park-resolution in one handler invocation, so `resolveWorkflowIrForTask` reads selection once per task
per tick, never O(n × passes). The cache is PER-TICK ONLY and the resolver coalesces even concurrent
wake closures that share the same cache onto ONE in-flight read. The next tick/event creates a fresh
Map (and thus a fresh coalescing slot) so a concurrent selection WRITE is observed there; this is the
FNXC:WorkflowScheduling invariant, never a global/infinite LRU. A throwing read is deliberately not
cached — so instrumentation MUST count reads, not infer them from cache keys.

Wake mechanics this suite relies on (all from the `task:updated` handler):
  - unpause wake:	 `paused>>false`/`userPaused>>false` armed via a prior `paused:true` event.
  - planning wake:	 `status:"planning"` armed via a prior event, then a `status:null` event clears it.
  - approval wake:	 `status:"awaiting-approval"` armed via a prior event, then a `status:null` event
                     with `approvedPlanFingerprint` clears it.
  Each arm-only event reads nothing; only the clearing transition fires the park-resolution closure.

REG invariant (surface enumeration):
 - one event clearing unpause + planning + approval wakes for the SAME task reads selection exactly once
   (not 3x) — the concurrent wake closures coalesce onto one shared per-tick read.
 - MULTIPLE distinct tasks reached in one sweep each read at most once (per-task bound).
 - EMPTY task set / no wake transitions: ZERO selection reads.
 - the cache NEVER leaks across events: a second tick's wake re-reads (selection is mutable) — the
   dedup is per-tick, not a permanent memo.
 - sync fallback parity: when the store exposes only the legacy sync `getTaskWorkflowSelection`, the same
   per-tick cache still dedups concurrent reads.

/*
FNXC:WorkflowScheduling 2026-08-16 (RUFU-106, RUFU-073 surface enumeration):
The read-once invariant is not only about the `task:updated` wake coalescing tested above — it must
hold on EVERY cache-propagation surface that resolves parked columns for a task. The scheduler
creates a fresh per-event selectionCache in EACH handler (`task:moved` -> `movedSelectionCache`,
`task:deleted` -> `deletedSelectionCache`, `task:updated` -> `updatedSelectionCache`) so a single
event can never issue more than one workflow_selection read per task. These cases pin that guarantee
on the remaining enumerated surfaces so a future edit that drops one of the caches (falling back to
O(n × passes)) fails loudly. Each assertion counts SELECTION READS (instrumented in the mock store),
never cache keys — a throwing read is deliberately not cached.
