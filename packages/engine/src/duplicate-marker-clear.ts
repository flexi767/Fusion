 * signal the scheduler wakes on, so a prompt-less null-status card re-dispatches,
 * FS-fails, and storms (observed on FN-8704 / inactive FN-8676).

 * Inactive/dismissed-id markers are cleared for replanning because completed and archived work is
 * historical context, never an actionable duplicate, regardless of task provenance.
