# AgentPulse used-feature inventory (Phase 0 gate)

Measured: 2026-09-24, against the live production AgentPulse on J
(`agentpulse.service`, `agentpulse-supervisor.service`, `agentpulse-private-relay.service`,
SQLite at `/home/ubuntu/.agentpulse/data/agentpulse.db`, 1,013,276,672 bytes).

The integration plan scopes parity to "the AgentPulse features **used in this deployment**".
This inventory answers that from data rather than from the source tree: a feature whose tables
hold zero rows after the deployment's whole lifetime is not in use here. Row counts are the
evidence; the code surface exists for all of them.

## Used — these need a Fusion equivalent

| AgentPulse capability | Evidence (rows) | Fusion status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session observation | `sessions` 556 | **Done.** Phase 1; `external_sessions`, Remote agents panel. |
| Session events | `events` 96,006 | **Done.** Observation ingestion with durable replay. |
| Turn history / results | covered by `events` | **API only.** Migration 0088 + `/external-sessions/:id/turns` are deployed and paginated; nothing renders them. Largest gap. |
| Full-text search over output | `search_events_fts` 67,148 docs; `search_sessions_fts` 556 | **Missing.** Phase 5. Genuinely used at scale. |
| AI watcher runs | `ai_watcher_runs` 817 | **Missing.** Phase 5 summaries. Heaviest AI usage in the deployment. |
| Session control actions | `control_actions` 7 | **Missing.** Phase 4 stop/resume, capability-gated. |
| Managed sessions | `managed_sessions` 4 | **Partial.** Fusion owns its own sessions; external managed-session control is Phase 4. |
| Launch requests | `launch_requests` 4 | **Missing.** Low usage; candidate for a named follow-up rather than parity. |
| Supervisors + credentials | `supervisors` 3, `supervisor_credentials` 3 | **Equivalent.** Fusion host-scoped collector credentials cover host identity/auth. |
| Ask threads | `ask_threads` 1, `ask_messages` 2 | **Near-unused.** Fusion Chat is the equivalent; propose follow-up, not parity. |
| Settings | `settings` 9 | **Equivalent.** Fusion global settings. |
| LLM providers | `llm_providers` 1 | **Equivalent.** Fusion provider/credential settings. |
| API keys | `api_keys` 1 | **Equivalent.** Collector credentials. |
| Cost overview / popover | `CostOverview.tsx`, `CostPopover.tsx` | **Partial.** Session + card totals done; turn costs, effective-dated rates and rankings open. |

## Not used in this deployment — zero rows, not parity requirements

`watcher_proposals`, `watcher_configs`, `users`, `supervisor_enrollment_tokens`,
`session_templates`, `projects`, `project_alert_rules`, `project_alert_rule_fires`,
`notification_channels` (Telegram), `event_embeddings` (vector search), `auth_sessions`,
`ai_qa_cache`, `ai_pending_project_drafts`, `ai_inbox_snoozes`.

This retires a large amount of assumed scope: Telegram channels, project alert rules, session
templates, vector/semantic search, the HITL inbox snooze flow and AgentPulse's own user/auth
model carry no data here. Each is recorded as a **named follow-up**, not a blocker, per the
Phase 0 gate wording ("no unassigned used capability"). If any is later switched on in
AgentPulse, it re-enters scope and this table must be re-measured.

## Correction, measured 2026-09-24: row counts over-counted usage

The first pass of this inventory treated a non-zero row count as evidence of use. That was wrong, and it
over-stated four capabilities. Re-measured by timestamp and by durable output:

**Everything except sessions and events is confined to one 4-minute commissioning window.**

| Table | Rows | First → last |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `events` | 96,180 | 2026-07-12 → 2026-09-23 (ongoing) |
| `ask_threads` / `ask_messages` | 1 / 2 | 2026-09-15 09:11:01 → 09:11:13 |
| `launch_requests` | 4 | 2026-09-15 09:13:22 → 09:17:03 |
| `managed_sessions` | 4 | 2026-09-15 09:13:26 → 09:17:08 |
| `control_actions` | 7 | 2026-09-15 09:14:50 → 09:17:25 |

The control actions carry the synthetic prompt "Reply exactly: follow-up control passed. Do not use tools.",
and their `metadata_json.executionState` is `failed` ("No conversation found with session ID") even though the
outer row status is `succeeded`. These are commissioning tests of the control path, not operator use.

**The AI watcher runs but retains nothing.** All 817 runs are `status=succeeded`, `trigger_kind=idle`, with no
error sub-type, and they continue daily (162 on 09-19, 3 on 09-23). But:

- `proposal_id` is set on **0** of them, and `watcher_proposals` holds 0 rows.
- `sessions.plan_summary`, `current_task`, `semantic_status`, `watcher_state` and `watcher_last_run_at` are
  populated on **0** of 556 sessions.
- No `event_type` relates to AI or summaries; the 12 types are all transcript/hook events.
- `sum(ai_spend_cents)` is **0** across 0 sessions.

The provider is genuinely configured (`M3 MLX Qwen3.5 2B 4-bit`, openai_compatible, `http://m3:8080/v1`), so
this is not a missing-configuration artifact. The feature executes and produces no durable, user-visible
output in this deployment.

**Consequence.** Porting AI summaries would reproduce a subsystem whose measured output here is nothing, and
Phase 6 could not reconcile it against anything, because there is no stored summary to compare. Likewise,
controls, launches, managed sessions and Ask have no operator-generated history to reconcile. They are
recorded as named follow-ups on the same footing as the zero-row features below, and should be built when
someone wants the capability — not to reach parity with data that does not exist.

Genuinely used, continuously, for two and a half months: **session observation, transcript events, turn
results and the search index built from them**. Those are ported.

## Consequences for ordering

1. Turn history rendering (Phase 2) — DONE.
2. Search over collected output (Phase 5) — DONE. 67k indexed documents, real demonstrated use.
3. Operational health (Phase 5) — collector lag, spool depth, last acknowledgement, parse and command
   failures. Not an AgentPulse port; it is what makes the ported pipeline observable, and it is the only
   remaining item that serves day-to-day operation.
4. Rest of Phase 3 — per-turn costs, context size vs capacity, effective-dated rates, rankings.
5. AI summaries, controls, launches, managed sessions, Ask — build on request, not for parity. See the
   correction above: none has durable operator-generated data in this deployment.

Historical import (Phase 6) must carry `sessions` 556 and `events` 96,006, and its
reconciliation report is what proves parity. Retiring AgentPulse still requires separate
explicit approval, and the recovery snapshot is retained regardless.
